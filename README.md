### Repl

Start repl: `sbt run` (not that you quit, you need to :quit out of the repl and then ctrl-c out of sbt)
Run tests: `sbt test`

You can also use :load as in the standard scala repl to load in multiple lines to be interpreted.

### Compile to a single file

sbt "run datalog_file runnable.cpp"

### Server

Compile using makefile in emptyheaded. Run `./bin/server` to start the server.
